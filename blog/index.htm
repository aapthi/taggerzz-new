<p>Welcome to Taggerzz! Taggerzz.com is an online platform where netizens and technophiles can catalog and share information on anything that piques their interest on the internet using web, hot or direct links.
The primary objective of taggerzz.com is to provide an enriched web browsing experience to its users by helping them collect, organize, #tag and share information, while respecting their privacy and anonymity at all times.
</p>

<h2 class="heading_cnt">Main Features of Taggerzz.com</h2>
<h3>#Tagging</h3>
<p>#tagging is arguably, the single most revolutionary factor in social bookmarking. Taggerzz.com is designed to facilitate #tagging entire collections of hyperlinks. Such collections of hyperlinks are called ‘Highlights’ and ‘Databoxes’  on taggerzz.com, and they can be either private or publicly accessible.
</p>
<h3>Highlights #Tagged by Members</h3>
<p>A highlight can be created by a user in a few simple steps, after clicking on ‘Start #tagging’ on the header of taggerzz.com. Highlights created by the user are displayed as the main content on the home page. A major portion of each highlight consists of an image chosen by the user. This helps to quickly identify the highlight without having to read a lot of textual information. Other bits of information about the highlight, like keywords, the number of hot links within the highlight, counters for views, votes and shares, and a brief description of the highlight also help the user to ascertain what the highlight contains at a glance.</p>

<p>A highlight created on taggerzz.com does not represent news or trending topics. Rather, they are more of a representation of the user’s personal interests and opinions. A highlight can receive votes from both logged in as well as unregistered users of taggerzz.com based on the quality of the content and similarity of interests among the voters.
Highlights on taggerzz.com will be displayed on the home page in ascending order, with the first highlight displayed first.  The user can edit the #tag, title, web links, content and comments in customization mode. A highlight can contain a maximum of #100 limited links.
</p>

<h3>Databoxes (Public & Private)</h3>
<p>By providing private and public modes, taggerzz.com doesn’t restrict its registered users. Public databoxes are visible to online search engines, and are accessible to pretty much anyone online. #tags, titles, keywords and the whole collection of links in public databoxes can be crawled by all major search engine bots, allowing them to be available globally at all times.
</p>
<p>Private databoxes on taggerzz.com on the other hand, are not accessible to search engine crawler bots. The contents of these databoxes can be accessed only by users who have its #tag and its freshly generated unique combination code. Users can search and find private databoxes only if they have both its #tag and its unique code.
</p>
<h3>Public Databoxes</h3>
<p>Public databoxes can be created by clicking on “Start #tagging” on the page header, and following a few simple steps. First, the user has to create a #tag and title for the databox. Next, he/she can upload a valid bookmark file (usually a file with a .json or .bak extension) and either select individual web links from the uploaded bookmark file, or choose to upload all the web links with the folder and sub-folder structure. If the user wants to manually insert his/her web links, he/she can skip uploading a bookmark file and do so in the final step.
</p>
<strong>In the Final Step, the user can:</strong>
<ul class="points_text">
<li>Manually insert web links</li>
<li>Define the collection of web links as "NSFW (Not safe for Work)" or "Mature content"</li>
<li>Specify 'Related Keywords/categorization' for the collection of his/her web links</li>
<li>Upload an appropriate image that would represent the databox </li>
</ul>
<p>Upon successfully completing the above steps, the user can proceed to customize and publish his/her databox as a link post.
The #tag, title, web links, content and user comments of the public databox are editable in customization mode.
A public databox can contain a maximum of #100  limited links.</p>

<h3>Private Databoxes</h3>
<p>Private databoxes can be created by clicking on “Start #tagging” on the page header, and following a few simple steps. First, the user has to create a #tag and title for the databox. Next, he/she can upload a valid bookmark file (usually a file with a .json or .bak extension) and either select individual web links from the uploaded bookmark file, or choose to upload all the web links with the folder and sub-folder structure. If the user wants to manually insert his/her web links, he/she can skip uploading a bookmark file and do so in the final step, where he/she can also generate or re-generate a unique #tag combination code. This allows the user to share the databox anonymously  with select individuals via email.
</p>
<p>Upon successfully completing the above steps, the user can proceed to customize and publish his/her databox as a link post.</p>
<strong>In the Final Step, the user can:</strong>
<ul class="points_text">
<li>Manually insert web links </li>
<li>Generate,  re-generate or manually specify a unique #tag combination code </li>
<li>Upload an appropriate image that would represent the databox </li>
<li>Enter the email ids of contacts he/she wants to share the databox with </li>
</ul>
<p>The unique code of a private databox can be changed by the user who created and/or shared it at any time. The #tag, title, web links, content and user comments of a private databox are editable in customization mode.
A private databox can contain a maximum of #100  limited links.
</p>
<h3>Sharing Bookmark Files</h3>

<p>Taggerzz.com values bookmarks. Usually confined to individual web browsers around the world, bookmarks are largely considered to be ‘shortcuts’ that give the user a convenient browsing experience. If a user finds something interesting on the internet, he/she can bookmark that web page in order to return to it at a later time. By doing so, however, the user has performed a minor act of curation. By bookmarking a web page, the user is actually implying that there’s something interesting there. The more users bookmark a page, the more likely it is to find relevant content there. 
</p>
<p>Taggerzz.com enables its users to upload their bookmark files from Chrome and Mozilla browsers. Our linear research indicates that most users only use their bookmark files to reload their bookmarks into a new browser profile or a newly installed browser. There’s no medium that enables users to share their bookmarks with other users so as to take advantage of a collectively curated list of web resources. Taggerzz.com facilitates the safe usage of bookmark files on its domain with complete respect to user privacy. The user can choose which web links they want to share from within the bookmarks files they select to upload. At no time and in no way can taggerzz.com access the user’s bookmarks without their express permission.
</p>

<h3>Customization Mode of Highlights, Public & Private Databoxes</h3>
<p>Once a collection of web links has been created, the user can go into Customization Mode at any time to make further changes. The user can reframe, resize, relocate and regroup web link posts or add comments to either a group of link posts or a single link post. All independent types of valid web links are converted to link posts upon exiting customization mode.
</p>
<strong> Displaying Link Posts as:</strong>
<ul class="points_text">

<li>Direct web links to images will be represented by a hyperlinked thumbnail of the image</li>
<li>Web links to web pages will be represented by the web page's title, image & available content</li>
<li>Direct web links to Notepad, MS Word, Powerpoint, Photoshop, Illustrator or Indesign files will be represented by their respective Application Icons</li>
<li>Web links to videos from major video portals will show up as thumbnail videos with overlaid playback controls</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits of Using Unique Hashtags</h3>
<p>Highlights &amp; Public Databoxes with unique #tags are picked up more easily by major search engines. This helps users find relevant highlights more efficiently when they use search engines. For an example, please take a look at the image below.
